# what more can you add to this to make my deep research prompt most effective

To make your deep research prompt for Claude and Cursor maximally effective, you can incorporate several advanced prompt engineering strategies and best practices drawn from expert sources:

## Key Enhancements for Your Deep Research Prompt

**1. Assign a Role and Expertise**

- Explicitly instruct the AI to act as a specific expert (e.g., “Act as a senior enterprise software architect and AI research analyst”) to focus its reasoning and output[^2][^3][^8].

**2. State Your Objective Clearly**

- Begin with a concise statement of your research goal and what you want the AI to accomplish. Ambiguity leads to weaker results[^1][^4][^6].

**3. Specify Output Format and Detail Level**

- Tell the AI exactly how you want results presented: as a checklist, table, bullet points, or a structured report. Define the level of depth, e.g., “Provide a summary and then a detailed breakdown for each item”[^2][^4][^8].

**4. Use Positive, Specific Instructions**

- Focus on what you want (“Include actionable recommendations for each tool”) rather than what to avoid (“Don’t be vague”)[^8].

**5. Provide Examples**

- If you want a certain style or structure, include a brief example or template in your prompt. This guides the AI’s tone and format[^3][^4][^7].

**6. Set Constraints and Priorities**

- Define any limits (e.g., “List no more than 20 tools,” “Prioritize those with open-source licenses,” “Focus on code efficiency and security”)[^4][^8].

**7. Encourage Step-by-Step Reasoning**

- Ask the AI to “think step by step” or “explain its reasoning” to improve depth and reliability of the results[^4][^5][^6].

**8. Request Source Citations or Evidence**

- For deep research, instruct the AI to cite sources or provide links for each recommendation. This increases trustworthiness and allows for further investigation[^6].

**9. Tailor for Audience and Context**

- Specify your audience (“For CTOs and enterprise developers”) and any relevant context (“This is for a high-compliance fintech environment”)[^2][^7].

**10. Invite Iteration and Questions**

- Ask the AI to identify any missing information or to ask clarifying questions before proceeding, ensuring the output is as relevant as possible[^7].

**11. Use Meta-Prompting for Complex Tasks**

- For multi-step research, break your request into sub-tasks or ask the AI to plan its approach before executing (“First, outline your research plan, then execute each step”)[^5][^6].

## Example of a Maximally Effective Deep Research Prompt

> Act as a senior enterprise software architect and AI research analyst.
> My objective: Identify and evaluate the top 20 MCP servers or plugins that, when installed with Claude Desktop and Cursor, will maximize productivity, code quality, and enterprise-readiness for building an advanced CRM.
>
> - Present your findings in a two-part output: first, a summary table (tool, purpose, why essential); second, a detailed explanation for each.
> - Focus on code efficiency, security, CI/CD, documentation, and AI integration.
> - Prioritize tools with strong community support and open-source licenses.
> - For each recommendation, provide a brief rationale and, where possible, a reputable source or link.
> - If information is missing or ambiguous, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.
> - Think step by step, and explain your reasoning throughout.
> - Audience: CTOs and enterprise AI developers in fintech.
> - Tone: Professional, concise, actionable.
>
> If you need more context, ask before starting.

## Summary of Best Prompting Principles

- **Be clear, specific, and positive in instructions**[^1][^4][^8].
- **Assign roles and define audience**[^2][^3][^7][^8].
- **Specify output format and constraints**[^2][^4][^8].
- **Encourage step-by-step, evidence-based reasoning**[^4][^5][^6].
- **Provide examples and context**[^3][^4][^7].
- **Invite iteration and clarifying questions**[^7].

By integrating these strategies, your prompt will unlock the deepest, most actionable research from Claude, Cursor, or any advanced AI agent.
