# give me prompt instructions to build a similar crm dashboard with my dialer intergrated into it. i want it to match my color scheme and logo and font

Here’s a prompt you can use in Loveable (or any modern AI/low-code builder) to build a CRM dashboard that integrates your dialer, matches your Dynagen branding, and uses your logo and font. This prompt is tailored to ensure your dashboard looks and feels like the example you provided, but with your unique color scheme and branding:

---

**Prompt:**

> **Build a CRM dashboard web application for Dynagen Lending that integrates our dialer directly into the dashboard. The design should closely match the layout and data visualization style of the attached example, but use our Dynagen color scheme (\#c7d66d light green, \#00b6e3 blue, \#8cc63f green, \#a2a2a2 grey), our Dynagen logo (attached), and our preferred font (Montserrat or a similar clean sans-serif).**
>
> **Key Features:**
> - Top navigation bar with Dynagen logo and brand colors.
> - Main dashboard with widgets for:
>   - Total Loans, Loan Amount, Loan Balance, Balance Change YoY, Delinquency Rate.
>   - Loan Survival Rates (bar and line chart).
>   - Upcoming Maturities (vertical bar chart).
>   - Clients at Risk of Default (horizontal bar chart with risk scores).
>   - Opportunities and Referrals panels.
>   - All Leads panel with lead quality, owner, and contact details.
>   - Task list and recent activity.
>   - News feed or announcement panel.
> - Integrated dialer panel (iframe or API-driven) for click-to-call, call status, and call logging, always visible on the dashboard.
> - Responsive layout for desktop and tablet.
> - Ability to filter and search leads, opportunities, and tasks.
> - All charts and widgets styled with Dynagen’s color palette and font.
> - Allow user to upload or change logo and adjust accent color in settings.
>
> **Stretch Features (optional):**
> - Real-time sentiment indicator for calls.
> - Multilingual toggle (English/Spanish).
> - Widget customization (drag, resize, hide).
>
> **Design Guidance:**
> - Use the attached screenshot as a reference for layout and widget arrangement.
> - Use Dynagen’s green as the dashboard background/accent, blue for highlights, and grey for neutral elements.
> - All buttons, charts, and icons should use the Dynagen color palette.
> - Use Montserrat font throughout.
> - Place the Dynagen logo in the top left and as a faint watermark in the background if possible.
>
> **Technical:**
> - Use React (preferred), Vue, or similar.
> - For dialer integration, use our dialer’s API or embed the dialer in an iframe.
> - Mock data for all widgets; create placeholder API endpoints for future backend integration.
> - Comment all code and modularize components for easy expansion.
