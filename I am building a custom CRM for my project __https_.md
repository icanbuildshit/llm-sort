### Additional Noteworthy MCPs for Advanced Use Cases

- **Sequential Thinking MCP**: Breaks down complex problems for structured solutions[^16].
- **Knowledge Graph Memory MCP**: Maintains project context across sessions[^16].
- **Taskmaster MCP**: Advanced workflow automation[^9].
- **Kubernetes MCPs**: For DevOps and infrastructure management[^19].
- **Redis MCP**: Cloud database management[^19].
- **Portainer MCP**: Container orchestration and monitoring[^19].


## Installation \& Configuration Best Practices

**General Setup Steps:**

1. **Install Node.js** (and Python/UV if required) on your development machine[^3].
2. **Use Composio MCP** for streamlined setup with Claude Desktop and Cursor:

```
npx @composio/mcp@latest setup "&lt;MCP_SERVER_URL&gt;" --client claude
```

3. **Configure MCP servers** in `.cursor/mcp.json` (project-specific) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global)[^3].
4. **Authenticate** as needed (API keys, OAuth tokens).
5. **Test and verify** each integration.

**Example Configuration Snippet:**

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "github": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token-here" }
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"],
    "env": { "DIRECTORIES": "/path/to/your/folder" }
  }
}
```

**Centralized vs. Local Hosting:**

- For enterprise teams, centralize MCP server management for consistency, security, and easier maintenance[^11].
- Use cloud infrastructure (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS) for scalability, but ensure compliance and access controls.


## Enterprise Software Engineering Principles and Practices

**Core Principles:**

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prioritize simplicity for maintainability and onboarding[^18].
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Reuse code and avoid redundancy[^18].
- **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It):** Only build what's needed-avoid overengineering[^18][^7].
- **Separation of Concerns:** Modularize components for clarity and testability[^18].
- **SOLID Principles:** For scalable, robust, and adaptable architecture[^18].
- **Integration \& Reuse:** Leverage proven libraries, frameworks, and MCPs to reduce risk and accelerate delivery[^15].
- **Automated CI/CD:** Use tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, and Azure DevOps for continuous integration and deployment[^5][^13].
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Use Notion, Confluence, and automated tools for up-to-date project knowledge[^13][^9].
- **Agile/DevOps Methodology:** Adopt iterative development and rapid feedback cycles[^7].

**AI-Driven Development Tips:**

- Use AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Aider, AskCodi) for code generation, review, and documentation[^6][^14].
- Break down tasks for AI into clear, manageable prompts[^6].
- Keep project context updated for AI with Memory Bank and Knowledge Graph MCPs[^16].
- Validate AI-generated code for security and compliance.
