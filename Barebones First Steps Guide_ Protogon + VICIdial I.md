## Barebones First Steps Guide: Protogon + VICIdial Integration (Baby Implementation)

This guide gives you a simple, step-by-step path to get your first working version of a Protogon-style AI lending system with VICIdial at the core. The focus: get a real dialer running, connect it to your data, and lay the groundwork for future AI features. No fluff-just the basics you need to see it live.

---

### **1. Define Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

- **Goal:** Outbound/inbound call center for lending, with agent monitoring and basic reporting.
- **Must-Have:** VICIdial running, agents making/receiving calls, leads loaded, and simple reporting.
- **Future Add-ons:** Real-time AI coaching, sentiment analysis, CRM integration, multilingual support.

---

### **2. Prepare Your Environment**

- **Hardware:** At least 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 100GB disk (for small team/testing).
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or CentOS 7 (recommended for VICIdial).
- **Network:** Static IP, open ports (SIP, web, SSH), reliable internet.

---

### **3. Install VICIdial (Dialer Engine)**

- **Quick Start:**
    - Use a virtual machine (VM) or cloud server (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.).
    - Follow a step-by-step video or written guide for beginners[^3][^4]:
        - Download VICIdial ISO or use a prebuilt image.
        - Install OS, set static IP, and configure time zone.
        - Run VICIdial installer scripts.
        - Verify installation by accessing the web admin panel.
- **Resources:**

    - [Step-by-Step Blog Guide](https://www.omid.blog/2023/05/vicidial-installation-masterclass-step.html)[^3]

---

### **4. Set Up Phones, Agents, and Campaigns**

- **Login to VICIdial Admin Panel**
- **Create Phones:**
    - Register softphones (e.g., Zoiper, X-Lite) for each agent.
- **Create Users:**
    - Add agent accounts with passwords.
- **Create Campaigns:**
    - Outbound: Set up a campaign, load a small test list of leads (CSV).
    - Inbound: Set up ingroups/queues if needed.
- **Assign Agents to Campaigns**

---

### **5. Test Call Functionality**

- **Make a Test Call:**
    - Login as an agent, join the campaign, and place a test call.
    - Confirm call connects, audio works both ways, and call is logged.
- **Check Reports:**
    - Use built-in real-time and historical reports to verify agent activity and call stats[^2][^3].

---

### **6. Connect VICIdial to External Data (Baby API Integration)**

- **Goal:** Push/pull lead data or call results between VICIdial and your CRM/spreadsheet.
- **How:**
    - Use VICIdial’s HTTP API or simple CSV import/export[^2][^5].
    - For now, do manual exports from CRM and import into VICIdial, or vice versa.
    - Explore the NON-AGENT API for automation as you grow[^5].

---

### **7. Monitor and Troubleshoot**

- **Live Monitor:** Use VICIdial’s real-time monitoring tools to listen in or view agent status[^2].
- **QC/Scorecards:** Start with manual call grading using VICIdial’s built-in tools[^2].
- **Fix Issues:** Check logs for errors, confirm network/firewall settings if calls fail.

---

### **8. Plan Your Next Steps (Stack and Test)**

- **After MVP is stable:**
    - Add simple CRM integration (Zoho, Salesforce, Google Sheets).
    - Experiment with basic AI features (sentiment analysis, live prompts) using open APIs.
    - Add multilingual scripts or translation for target markets.
    - Explore advanced agent coaching and analytics.

## **Summary Table**

| Step | Action | Outcome |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Define MVP | Clear, simple project scope |
| 2 | Prepare Environment | Ready-to-install server |
| 3 | Install VICIdial | Working dialer system |
| 4 | Set Up Phones/Agents/Campaigns | Agents can make/receive calls |
| 5 | Test Calls \& Reports | Confirm system is functional |
| 6 | Connect Data (Manual/API) | Leads flow in/out |
| 7 | Monitor \& Troubleshoot | Stable, reliable operation |
| 8 | Plan Next Features | Roadmap for future upgrades |


---

**That’s it.**
Get VICIdial up, make calls, see data flow, and build confidence. Once this is working, you can start layering on AI, analytics, and integrations-one step at a time[^2][^3][^4][^5].
