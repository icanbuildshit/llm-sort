# Task Master Guide for DynaGen AI Implementation

## Getting Started

### Initialize the Project

First, initialize a new Task Master project in your DynaGen directory:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd 'E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1'

# Initialize a new Task Master project
task-master init --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1"
```

This creates the necessary folder structure for your tasks.

### Create PRD File

Create a PRD (Product Requirements Document) file based on the DynaGen Lending AI Evaluation Framework:

```bash
# Make sure the scripts directory exists
mkdir -p scripts

# Create the PRD file
cat > scripts/dynagen-ai-prd.txt << 'EOF'
# DynaGen Lending AI Evaluation Framework (DynagenDashV1)

## Overview

DynagenDashV1 is Phase 1 of the PROTOGON platform, designed to implement a comprehensive AI question/solution evaluation framework combining Bayesian statistics and quantitative analysis to optimize loan screening, call analysis, and risk assessment.

## Business Objectives

- Achieve 75% improvement in identifying high-potential applicants through advanced voice pattern analysis
- Reduce manual review time by 50-70% via streamlined processes and robust automation
- Increase qualified approvals by 20-40% through refined, data-driven assessments
- Improve call-to-loan conversion rates by 15-25% by empowering collaboration and effective toolsets
- Reduce bad loans by 10-20% with AI-driven behavior analytics that identify hidden red flags early

## Implementation Components

1. System Architecture Design

   - Statistical measurement tools for model evaluation
   - Integration with existing dashboards

4. Integration Layer
   - API endpoints for data exchange
   - Feedback loop implementation
   - Real-time updating mechanisms

5. Call Analysis Enhancement

### Parse PRD and Generate Tasks

Parse the PRD to automatically generate tasks:

```bash
# Parse the PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1" --input "scripts/dynagen-ai-prd.txt" --numTasks 12
```

### List All Generated Tasks

View all tasks created from the PRD:

```bash
# List all tasks
task-master list --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1"
```

The output will show all tasks with their IDs, titles, and statuses.

### Find the Next Task to Work On

Determine the next task based on dependencies and priority:

```bash
# Show the next task to work on
task-master next --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1"
```

This will identify the highest priority task that's ready to be worked on (with all dependencies satisfied).

### Generate Task Files

Create detailed markdown files for each task:

```bash
# Generate task files
task-master generate --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1"
```

This creates individual markdown files in the tasks directory with all task details.

## Working with Tasks

### Expanding Tasks into Subtasks

For complex tasks, break them down into manageable subtasks:

```bash
# Expand a specific task (replace 1 with the actual task ID)
task-master expand-task --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1" --id 1 --num 5
```

### Updating Task Status

Update the status of tasks as you progress:

```bash
# Update task status (replace 1 with the actual task ID)
task-master set-task-status --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1" --id 1 --status "in-progress"
```

Available statuses include: pending, in-progress, review, done, deferred, cancelled.

### Adding Custom Tasks

Add tasks that weren't generated from the PRD:

```bash
# Add a new task
task-master add-task --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1" --prompt "Create a detailed test plan for the Bayesian framework implementation"
```

### Analyzing Project Complexity

Analyze the complexity of your tasks to identify potential challenges:

```bash
# Analyze project complexity
task-master analyze-project-complexity --projectRoot "E:\Users\Randy Work\Documents\dynagendashv1"
```

## Best Practices for DynaGen Implementation

1. **Start with Architecture**: Begin with System Architecture Design tasks to establish the foundation.

2. **Follow Dependencies**: Work on tasks in the order recommended by `next-task` to ensure all prerequisites are met.

3. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: Use `expand-task` liberally for complex components like the Bayesian Framework and Call Analysis.

4. **Document as You Go**: Update task descriptions with implementation details and decisions made.

5. **Validate Dependencies**: Regularly use `validate-dependencies` to ensure your task graph remains healthy.

6. **Review Task Flow**: Periodically review the entire task list to ensure alignment with the DynaGen AI vision.

7. **Use for Documentation**: Generate comprehensive documentation from your tasks at project completion.

## Example Task Workflow

1. Initialize project and parse PRD
2. Start with architecture design tasks
3. Expand complex tasks into subtasks
4. Implement Bayesian framework and core components
5. Set up the integration layer
6. Implement AI-powered features
7. Configure compliance and security measures
8. Deploy and validate the implementation

This workflow follows the critical path identified in the implementation plan, focusing on establishing the foundation before building advanced capabilities.

## Three Thought-Provoking Questions

1. **How might we balance automation and human judgment in loan decisions?** As we implement Bayesian methods and AI-driven risk assessment, what is the optimal equilibrium between algorithmic decision-making and human expertise, particularly when considering edge cases or novel risk factors that may not be captured in historical data?

2. **What ethical considerations arise from behavioral analytics in lending?** As we analyze call patterns and verbal cues to assess risk, how can we ensure these systems don't perpetuate bias or unfairly penalize certain demographic groups, especially when voice patterns may vary across cultures and backgrounds?

3. **How can we measure the true ROI of our AI implementation beyond traditional metrics?** While we're tracking metrics like approval rates and bad loan reduction, what other measures might capture the full value of our system, including improved customer experience, employee satisfaction, and long-term relationship value?
