## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow these guiding principles from the PROTOGON requirements:

1. **Documentation-First**: All integrations require complete documentation before implementation begins, enforcing traceability and compliance.

2. **Redundancy and Resilience**: Build with multi-region replication, active/passive failover, and comprehensive rollback mechanisms to ensure system reliability.

3. **Modular Architecture**: Maintain single responsibility principle for all modules, with clear interface documentation and explicit naming conventions.

4. **Importance Weighting**: Implement sophisticated filtering mechanisms to prioritize high-impact questions and filter out unreliable information.

5. **Universal Reasoning**: Combine Bayesian statistics with causal inference and logic-based reasoning for more expressive frameworks.

6. **Prompt Engineering**: Create taxonomy of question types with clear guardrails to optimize for accuracy and prevent AI hallucinations.

7. **Continuous Learning**: Design the system to autonomously generate new questions as it detects coverage gaps or encounters novel problems.

8. **API-Driven Communication**: Ensure all components communicate through well-defined APIs, enabling loose coupling and independent evolution.

9. **Privacy by Design**: Embed data privacy and security principles from the beginning, with comprehensive audit logging and access controls.

10. **Future-Ready Design**: Architect the system to support expansion into new verticals and integration of additional AI modules.

This implementation plan integrates Bayesian statistics, quantitative analysis, importance weighting, universal reasoning, prompt engineering, and continuous learning into a cohesive system that will enhance DynaGen Lending's capabilities while following best practices for development and implementation.
