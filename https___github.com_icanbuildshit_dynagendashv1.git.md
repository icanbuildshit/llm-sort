write me a prompt for deep research on what would the requirments needed to buildthe attached protogon white paper with all the stuff we talked aobut prioor like beayesian statistics etc.

Here’s a research prompt you can use to guide a deep technical and business requirements analysis for building the PROTOGON white paper and DynagenDashV1 platform, incorporating advanced analytics, Bayesian statistics, KPI measurement, and integration with Wolfram, SAS Viya, and MATLAB:

## Deep Research Prompt for PROTOGON White Paper Requirements

**Objective:**
Conduct a comprehensive requirements analysis for designing and building the PROTOGON platform (DynagenDashV1 as Phase 1), a next-generation AI-powered Lending CRM and predictive analytics system. The analysis must address the following domains:

### 1. Core Business Problems to Solve

- What are the key inefficiencies, risks, and missed opportunities in current lending CRM and loan origination processes?
- How can real-time behavioral analytics, predictive modeling, and multilingual outreach transform agent performance, customer experience, and risk management in lending?


### 2. Feature and Functional Requirements

- Enumerate and describe all essential features for a modern lending CRM, including:
    - Lead and pipeline management
    - Automated document collection and compliance monitoring
    - AI-powered dialer, call analytics, and behavior tagging
    - Real-time KPI dashboards for agents and management
    - Predictive analytics for loan approval, fallout risk, and lead quality
    - Automated, multilingual marketing and outreach workflows
    - Role-based access control, security, and audit logging
- What features are required for future expansion into real estate, construction, and other financial verticals?


### 3. Advanced Analytics \& Statistical Modeling

- What are the requirements for integrating Bayesian statistics into credit scoring, risk modeling, and predictive analytics?
(e.g., updating approval probabilities as new borrower data arrives, using priors from historical models)[^4][^6]
- How should the platform leverage:
    - **Wolfram Language** for rule-based and probabilistic forecasting?
    - **SAS Viya** for real-time business analytics, KPI clustering, and risk dashboards?
    - **MATLAB** for regression modeling, anomaly detection, and dynamic KPI visualization?
- What are the best practices for combining Bayesian inference, machine learning, and quantitative analysis in lending?[^4][^6]


### 4. KPI Measurement and Business Intelligence

- What KPIs are most critical for loan origination, agent performance, customer engagement, and operational efficiency?
- How should the system collect, store, and visualize these KPIs in real time?
- What tools and integrations (e.g., SAS Viya, MATLAB) are optimal for advanced KPI analytics and dashboarding?


### 5. Data Architecture and Technology Stack

- What are the requirements for a scalable, secure, and unified data architecture (e.g., Supabase, PostgreSQL) to support CRM, call logs, behavioral data, and analytics?
- Which APIs and middleware are needed to connect with Wolfram, SAS Viya, MATLAB, and AI/NLP engines?
- What are the best practices for ensuring compliance, auditability, and data privacy in a regulated financial environment?[^8]


### 6. Automation, AI, and Personalization

- How should the platform automate lead nurturing, document requests, compliance alerts, and agent coaching?
- What are the requirements for multilingual AI agents and dynamic workflow generation?
- How can the system personalize outreach and agent feedback based on behavioral analytics and predictive modeling?


### 7. Security, Compliance, and Access Control

- What are the security, compliance, and user access requirements for a financial-grade CRM platform?
- How should the system handle KYC, TRID, LE, CD, and other regulatory timing and documentation requirements?[^7][^8]


### 8. Future-Proofing and Modular Expansion

- What architectural and design considerations will enable rapid expansion into new verticals (real estate, construction, etc.) and new AI-driven modules (e.g., predictive house flipping, franchise management)?

---

**Deliverables:**

- A detailed requirements document mapping out each feature, analytic integration, and business solution.
- Technical architecture diagrams showing data flows, analytics pipelines, and API integrations.
- A roadmap for MVP, Phase 2, and long-term expansion, with milestones for advanced analytics, compliance, and AI capabilities.

---

**Research should reference:**

- Best practices in AI-driven lending CRM and predictive analytics[^5][^8]
- Integration of Bayesian methods in credit scoring and risk management[^4][^6]
- Real-world examples of KPI measurement, business intelligence, and compliance in mortgage/lending platforms[^7][^8]
- Technology stack recommendations for scalable, secure, and compliant financial software

---

**Goal:**
Produce a white paper and technical blueprint that not only defines the requirements for DynagenDashV1/PROTOGON, but also demonstrates how advanced analytics, Bayesian statistics, and integrated business intelligence will deliver measurable competitive advantage in lending and beyond.
